# 🏗️ Building Architect Visualizer

A hackathon‑ready **full‑stack engineering simulation platform** that visualizes buildings in 3D and simulates structural behavior under disasters like earthquakes. The system combines advanced physics models, interactive dashboards, and real‑time visualization to help engineers, researchers, and decision‑makers understand **structural resilience, damage propagation, and safety outcomes**.
